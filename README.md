# PersonaCraft

I'm learning Elixir, and I've created this quirky API that generates a random person when a request is sent to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The name, surname, and occupation data are manually specified in the `data/personalities.json` file.

## Install

Before installing dependencies, clone the repository and execute the following command:
```bash
mix deps.get
```

## Development

Run server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
```bash
iex -S mix run
```

Have fun!
